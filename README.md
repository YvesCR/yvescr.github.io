This is the repo github of my web site.

My website is www.data-laborer.eu.

Currently, a github hosted version could be checked here: http://yvescr.github.io/blog.
I use the github repo as a development version of my site.

This is a jekyll website. This is my process to compile it:

  * First, write a post in R with rmarkdown.
  * Then compile and test locally the post, using `servr::jekyll()`.
  * Push the site to github and test online.
  * Push the site to my web host.
